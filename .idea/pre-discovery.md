Key stakeholders providing input on the problem space, user needs, and business objectives. 

## Problem Space Exploration
   - Discuss the current problem space
   - Identify key challenges and pain points
   - Gather insights from stakeholders on their perspectives

## System capabilities mapping
   - While gathering insights, also map out existing system capabilities
   - Determine and Identify gaps in current capabilities
   - Identify high-level areas for improvement or enhancement

## Logical Architecture
   - Arrange gathered information in a domain-specific workflow structure

   - Identify gaps in the current system architecture
   - Translate business needs into technical requirements to bridge business and technical teams

## Artifacts
   - Document the outcomes of the pre-discovery session
   - Create a summary report outlining the problem space, system capabilities, and logical architecture
   - Share the report with all stakeholders for feedback and alignment
   - Create a visual representation of the logical architecture to facilitate discovery sessions (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts)

## Next Steps
    - Schedule follow-up meetings for incremental understanding and to discuss findings and refine the discovery phase
    - Prepare for the discovery phase by identifying key resources and stakeholders
