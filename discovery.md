# discovery session
## Purpose
Conduct incremental understanding session to gather more information and to narrow down focus area.
Involve key stakeholders, impacted/ involved user groups, Business, Operations, technical groups.

## Problem Space Exploration
   - Ask detail questions and dig deep enough to reach to root of the problem
   - Understand the impact of the problem on the business and users
   - Identify impacted user groups and their needs
   - Identify impacted system components and their interactions

## Analysis of User Needs based on Problem Space
    - Identified success criteria 
    - Convert pre-discovery session assumptions into hypotheses
    - Conduct current state analysis to narrow down focus area

## Artifacts
   - Document the refined problem statement after the discovery session
   - Document capability gaps that is causing the problem
   - Create current state vs target state workflow that solves the root cause of the
   - Derive functional and non-functional requirements based on the refined problem statement
   - System context diagram 
   - Document assumptions and risks identified while identifying solution to a problem
   - Solutions options and each option's pros and cons

## Next Steps
    - Conduct solution review workshops
    - Finalize solution (one from the available options)
    - Identify impacted teams, systems and components
    - Create a roadmap for implementation based on the finalized solution
    - Finalized approved Solution in a design document
    - Review finalized design document with all stakeholders (including compliance, security, and legal teams)
    - Hand over solution to the development team for implementation
    - Maintain communication with all stakeholders throughout the implementation phase
    - Store all artifacts in a shared repository for future reference and knowledge sharing
